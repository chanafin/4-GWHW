Pandas Activities - Juptyer


GoodReads - the point of this exercise is to incorporate introductory Pandas  concepts and build upon Python knowledge. The first step is to import the csv as a DataFrame. This time, we'll use pd.read_csv, our introduction to Pandas. Since this is larger dataset, the next step is to drill down into the columns that need to be explored. This DataFrame as-is is not formatted. The next step is to rename the columns using the .rename function. Once the DataFrame is formatted properly and contains the columns that need to be explored, the DataFrame can be exported out to CSV. Other exercises that are explored are the functions of .nunique(), .min(), and .max() which are built in Pandas functions which detail the number of unique values, the miniumum value and the maximum value, respectively. The next step is to create a new column in the DataFrame which takes the sum of all 'Reviews' columns using the .sum function. As we are calculating these values, we are storing them in individual DataFrames which can be placed into one summary DataFrame.

FifaSearch - This continues to incorporate essential pandas elements. After reading in the CSV to a DataFrame, the task is to methodically drill down and identify the Worst Striker in Fifa. The first step is to Identify the unique values with the 'Preferred Position' column in the DataFrame using the .unique() function. Once the different positions are identified, the next step is to create a new DataFrame with that drills down on players that have the Preferred Position Value of 'ST'. This is accomplished through the .loc function. Once the Striker DataFrame has been created, the next step is to sort the entries by their 'Overall' value. This is done through the .sort_values('Overall') function. To make the new DataFrame more accessible, the next step is to reset the index so that each player's index number is reflective of their new placement in the DataFrame. This is done through the .reset_index(drop = True) function. The last step to find the worst striker in FIFA is to run an .iloc function which will then search for index 0, which is the reset index value for the player with the lowest Overall Score amongst Strikers.
